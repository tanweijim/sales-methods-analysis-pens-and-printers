# About
Pens and Printers was founded in 1984 and provides high quality office products to large
 organizations. We are a trusted provider of everything from pens and notebooks to desk
 chairs and monitors. We don’t produce our own products but sell those made by other
 companies.
 We have built long lasting relationships with our customers and they trust us to provide them
 with the best products for them. As the way in which consumers buy products is changing,
 our sales tactics have to change too. Launching a new product line is expensive and we need
 to make sure we are using the best techniques to sell the new product effectively. The best
 approach may vary for each new product so we need to learn quickly what works and what
 doesn’t.

 # New Product Sales Methods
 Six weeks ago we launched a new line of office stationery. Despite the world becoming
 increasingly digital, there is still demand for notebooks, pens and sticky notes.
 Our focus has been on selling products to enable our customers to be more creative, focused
 on tools for brainstorming. We have tested three different sales strategies for this, targeted
 email and phone calls, as well as combining the two.<br><br>
 **Email:** Customers in this group received an email when the product line was launched, and a
 further email three weeks later. This required very little work for the team.<br><br>
 **Call:** Customers in this group were called by a member of the sales team. On average
 members of the team were on the phone for around thirty minutes per customer.<br><br>
 **Email and call:** Customers in this group were first sent the product information email, then
 called a week later by the sales team to talk about their needs and how this new product
 may support their work. The email required little work from the team, the call was around ten
 minutes per customer.
